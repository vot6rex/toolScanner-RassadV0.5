# Security / Responsible Disclosure

We take reports seriously.

If you find a security vulnerability:
- **Do not** publish it publicly.
- Open a private issue if possible, or contact the repository owner.
- Provide clear reproduction steps and any logs (redact sensitive data).
- We will acknowledge and coordinate a fix or mitigation.

If you are unsure how to report securely, open an issue labeled `security` and request private communication.
